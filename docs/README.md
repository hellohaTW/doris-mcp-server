# Apache Doris MCP Server Documentation

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This documentation describes the 1.0 public contract. The root README is a
quick entry point; the documents below separate product architecture,
capability behavior, protocol, security, operations, reference, integration,
migration, and release concerns.

## Start here

| Goal | Document |
|---|---|
| Install and run a local Server | [Quick start](getting-started/quickstart.md) |
| Understand the 1.0 design | [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) |
| Follow one request end to end | [Request and data flow](architecture/request-lifecycle.md) |
| See every public domain | [Tool domains](capabilities/tool-domains.md) |
| Understand runtime availability | [Capability availability](capabilities/availability.md) |
| Connect an MCP Host | [Host integrations](integrations/hosts.md) |
| Deploy safely | [Deployment](operations/deployment.md) |

## Architecture

- [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) — component boundaries,
  top-level design, control plane, execution plane, and extension boundaries.
- [Request and data flow](architecture/request-lifecycle.md) — initialization,
  top-level discovery, domain discovery, child execution, Doris routing, and
  response construction.
- [ADR 0001: subscriptions require change events](decisions/0001-subscriptions-require-change-events.md)
- [ADR 0002: explicit state handles](decisions/0002-explicit-state-handles.md)

## Capabilities

- [Tool domains](capabilities/tool-domains.md) — the 8-domain/55-child contract.
- [Capability availability](capabilities/availability.md) — version parsing,
  probes, providers, permissions, manifests, and fail-closed behavior.
- [Doris version capability matrix](capabilities/doris-version-matrix.md) —
  the 2.0+ baseline and release-aware feature gates.
- [Generated tool registry](tool-registry.md) — authoritative generated names,
  handler bindings, authorization identifiers, variants, and migration inputs.

## Protocol

- [MCP 2026-07-28 contract](protocol/mcp-2026-07-28.md) — transports,
  pagination, schemas, errors, state handles, tracing, and legacy isolation.

## Security

- [Security and permission model](security/security-model.md) — authentication,
  authorization layers, query safety, data safety, secrets, and deployment
  policy.
- [Doris fine-grained access control](doris-fine-grained-access-control.md) —
  Doris RBAC, row policies, token-bound identities, and operational examples.

## Operations

- [Deployment](operations/deployment.md) — stdio, HTTP, Docker, proxies,
  workers, secrets, and rollout checks.
- [Reliability and limits](operations/reliability.md) — health, connection
  routing, failover, bounds, observability, fallbacks, and known limits.
- [Troubleshooting](operations/troubleshooting.md) — startup, readiness,
  authentication, capability, query, and transport diagnostics.

## Reference and integrations

- [Configuration reference](reference/configuration.md)
- [Host integrations](integrations/hosts.md)
- [MetricFlow integration](integrations/metricflow.md)
- [Custom tool providers](custom-tool-providers.md)

## Development, migration, and releases

- [Contributing and verification](development/contributing.md)
- [Design and extension guide](design.md) — file-level map of the subsystems and
  step-by-step recipes for adding tools, domains, authentication methods, and
  settings (written in Traditional Chinese).
- [Migrating to 1.0](migration/1.0.0.md)
- [1.0 release notes](releases/1.0.0.md)
- Compatibility release paths: [migration-1.0.0.md](migration-1.0.0.md) and
  [release-notes-1.0.0.md](release-notes-1.0.0.md)
- [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)
- [Detailed 1.0 release issue](https://github.com/apache/doris-mcp-server/issues/189)

## Documentation rules

- Runtime behavior and generated catalogs take precedence over prose.
- English and Simplified Chinese topic guides must keep the same section
  structure and operational meaning.
- The generated `tool-registry.md` must not be edited by hand.
- Examples must use placeholders rather than deployable credentials.
- A capability must not be documented as available solely because its Doris
  version range matches; runtime probes, provider state, and permissions are
  part of the contract.
